# We know that methods in Ruby can return values, and we usually ask a method
# to return a value when we want to use it in another part of our program, like this: 

def multiple_of_three(n)
  return n % 3 == 0 ? "True" : "False"
end

# If we don't put a return statement in our method definition, our Ruby method will then look like this:

def multiple_of_three(n)
  n % 3 == 0 ? "True" : "False"
end
# Removed the word 'return'

# Both statements output the same thing.
