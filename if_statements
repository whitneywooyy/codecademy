# An even more concise version of if/else is the 'ternary conditional expression'. 
# It's called "ternary" because it takes three arguments: a boolean, an expression 
# to evaluate if the boolean is true, and an expression to evaluate if the boolean is false.

puts true ? "True!" : "False!"

# The above ternary expression is the same as:

if true
  puts "True!"
else
  puts "False!"
end

# For the following: 
puts 5 < 3 ? "5 is less than 3" : "5 is not less than 3!"
# The console puts "5 is not less than 3!" because 5 < 3 is a boolean (T/F) and 5 is not less than 3.
