# truth tables!

true && true # => true
true && false # => false
false && true # => false
false && false # => false

true || true # => true
true || false # => true
false || true # => true
false || false # => false

# The && operator only returns true when the expressions on both sides of the operator are true; 
# || returns true when one or the other or both of the expressions involved are true. 
# 'Short-circuit evaluation' means that Ruby doesn't look at both expressions unless it has to; if it sees
false && true
# it stops reading as soon as it sees && because it knows false && anything must be false.
